        "content": "In this first-person perspective from the game 'DOOM', the agent is in a room with grey stone-textured walls. The environment ahead can be described as follows:\n\n1. Walls and obstacles: Directly in front of the agent, the wall has an elevated alcove-like structure or recess with an enemy standing within it. The wall runs perpendicular to the agent's line of sight. To the right at approximately 30 degrees, there is a continuation of the stone wall with an opening visible leading into another area.\n\n2. Enemy's position: There is one visible enemy straight ahead, standing approximately in the center of the visual field. It is positioned within the aforementioned alcove at a distance, directly facing the agent.\n\n3. Item's Positions:\na. There is a health package visible on the left side of the image. It appears to be adjacent to the inside edge of the left doorway, approximately at a 30-degree angle to the left of the agent.\nb. There is an ammo brown-colored shell item visible on the floor just to the left side - at about15 degrees to the left of the agent's direct forward path, and it's closer than the health package; roughly midway between the agent and the alcove with the enemy.\n\nThe environment gives off an ominous feeling typical of 'DOOM,' characterized by dim lighting conditions and presence of demonic enemies, further setting a forbidding atmosphere."
