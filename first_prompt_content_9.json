The agent is situated in a corridor-like environment with gray wall textures that give the appearance of large stone or concrete blocks. The walls are perpendicular to each other, forming corners at 90-degree angles, creating a hallway with the following details:\n\n1. Wall and Obstacle Position and Orientation:\n   - Directly in front of the agent, the corridor continues straight with walls on both sides. The wall on the right extends further into the distance before turning right at an unseen angle (not in view).\n   - On the left, a closer wall corner is visible; the wall turns to the left at about 30-45 degrees left theta from the agentâ€™s perspective.\n   \n2. Enemy Position:\n   - An enemy, which resembles a 'Former Human,' can be seen standing approximately at a 15 degrees right theta angle in the distance. The enemy is in the middle of the corridor and seems to be facing towards or firing at the player.\n\n3. Item Position:\n   - A health pack is noticeable on the wall to the left of the agent, indicating it is affixed to the wall rather than on the floor. This health pack is at approximately 15-20 degrees left theta from the agent's perspective.\n   - Ammo, which should appear as small brown-colored shells, is not explicitly visible in the provided image.\n\nThe environment is designed to exhibit a gritty, industrial aesthetic typical of 'DOOM' game scenarios. There are no visible obstacles in the immediate vicinity of the agent that would obstruct movement or line of sight."
