        "content": "The agent is in a narrow corridor-like environment with gray stone walls and ceiling. The space widens slightly ahead into a room.\n\n1. On both the left and right sides of the agent, running parallel to the agent's perspective, are even gray stone walls. Approximately six meters ahead, the corridor opens up into a larger space, but the exact dimensions cannot be ascertained from the current view.\n\n2. Two enemies are present directly ahead of the agent, within what appears to be a short distance. They are symmetrically positioned with respect to an unspecified central axis and are almost parallel to each other, roughly at a direct straight angle (0 degrees) from the agent's forward-facing line of sight.\n\n3. In the immediate foreground within the bottom left of the screen (roughly a 240-255 degree angle relative to the agent's forward view, requiring a sharp left turn to face directly), there is a health package, characteristic of white coloring with detail on the right and green on the left. Centered within the same foreground (roughly 180-190 degrees to the left), there appears to be an ammunition brown colored shell.\n\nIt is important to note that the angle notations I provided may vary slightly based upon the exact orientation and central axis assumed in a first-person perspective. The assumption is based on symmetries visible in the current layout and spatial relations implied by the game design."
