        "content": "In the image you have provided, which appears to be from the first-person shooter game 'DOOM,' the environment is a narrow corridor with gray stone-like textures on the walls, ceiling, and floor. Here is a description of the various elements you're asking about:\n\n1. Walls and Obstacle Positions:\n   - Right-side wall: Runs straight and continuous, parallel to the agent's perspective.\n   - Left-side wall: Similar to the right side, runs parallel and continuous.\n   - The corridor appears to end at a wall directly in front of the agent likely at an approximate angle of 0 degrees, although it is not fully visible due to the presence of an enemy.\n\n2. Enemy's Position:\n   - There is a single enemy directly in front of the agent at 0 degrees. It's quite close to the agent, occupying a significant portion of the corridor's width and looming over the player's viewpoint. The enemy has a brown and tan color and is characterized by large horns and red eyes.\n\n3. Item's Positions:\n   - Health Packages: Two apparent health packages are visible towards the right-hand side of the corridor. They are leaning against the right wall at an estimated angle of roughly 15 degrees to the right from the agent's current perspective.\n   - Ammo: No ammo items are clearly visible in the image you have shared.\n\nDue to image compression and limitations, nuances such as finer textures, other items that might be obscured, and exact angles may not be discernible. The health and ammo counts appear on the HUD, indicating the game status rather than being objects spotted within the 3D game environment represented in the image."
