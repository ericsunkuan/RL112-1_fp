        "content": "In the provided image from \"DOOM\", the in-game environment visible to the agent (player perspective) appears to be a corridor-like structure with nineteen gray textured wall segments positioned along both sides—the left wall extending beyond the right wall from the agent's perspective. The corridor features a symmetrical, orthogonal pathway ahead:\n\n- On the left side, starting from the agent's position and extending forward, there are ten consecutive wall segments followed by a turn. The angles formed with the agent's view start from nearly 90 degrees moving towards 0 degrees linearly with the depth of the corridor.\n- The right side mirrors the left side with nine consecutive wall segments and then extends further into an opening or larger space.\n\nRegarding obstacles and openings:\n\n- Directly in front of the agent, properly aligned, is a doorway-like opening approximately 0 to 20 degrees to the right of the central line of sight. This corresponds precisely to the end of the wall segments before the corridor seems to expand into a wider room.\n\nThere are two distinctive enemies present in the view:\n\n- The nearest enemy, towering and large, with brown textures and red details, is positioned just ahead of the agent, approximately 10 degrees to the left of the central line of sight.\n- Another similar enemy is located further down the corridor, equally centered and aligned progressively at a shallower angle towards the straight-ahead view as compared with the nearest enemy.\n\nRegarding items in the environment:\n\n1. Health package(s) specs:\n    - A white box with traces of red on the right and green on the left is visible in the corridor.\n    - There appears to be one health package on the corridor floor placed approximately at a centered view with respect to the walls; close to the distant enemy and the unfolding space ahead, around 0 degrees in alignment with the player’s center line of sight.\n\n2. Ammo specifics:\n    - A brown colored object signifying ammo (presumably shotgun shells) lies on the corridor floor. Placement-wise, it’s difficult to ascertain specific angular directions due to the quality of the image and size of the item. However, this single piece of ammo seems to be approximately in line with the player's midline as they approach the health package and far enemy, at a near-center angle almost synchronous with the central line of sight.\n\nIt should be noted that due to the diminishing perspective inherent in the image and the limitation of not being able to see the entire room or move the point of view around, certain positional descriptions may vary slightly from their real in-game locations."
