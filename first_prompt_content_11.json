        "content": "The screenshot provided appears to be from classic 'DOOM' gameplay. In this first-person view, you can see the environment consists primarily of textured gray stone walls and the floor shares a similar stone texture. Here are the details based on your requested focus:\n\n1. Wall’s and Obstacle’s Position and Orientation:\n- Directly in front of the agent is a corridor with gray stone walls on both sides stretching into the distance.\n- There is no immediate turn in the corridor visible; it extends straight forward from the agent’s perspective.\n\n2. Enemy's Position:\n- An enemy is visible towards the right of the agent's field of view. It's close by, approximately at a right angle of 45 degrees, and partially obscured by the player's weapon.\n\n3. Item's Position:\n- One health package is visible on the left-about 60 degrees to the left relative to the agent's forward-facing direction—and it's positioned at a distance down the corridor along the left wall.\n- The ammo you described isn't noticeable in this image.\n\nNB: Due to the limitations of the picture's resolution and the angle of the view, it's challenging to ascertain additional details about the environment behind and beside the agent with certainty. This description pertains to the visible field of view only."
