        "content": "You're looking at a classic DOOM game environment shown in the first-person perspective. Here's the detailed description:\n\n1. The walls in the scene are constructed with textured gray blocks giving a rough stone appearance characteristic of the game's design. The immediate wall directly in front of the agent blends to create a continuous surface, indicating a larger space or possibly a corridor.\n\n2. No enemies are visible in the direction the agent is facing in this current view.\n\n3. Two types of items are present in the field of view:\n   - A health package (a gleaming shine is spotted on the top, considering you mentioned one is white with a bit of red and green) is located directly in front of the agent at a distance equivalent to one short step away. Following the specified guidelines, its position relative to the agent is close to citing using specific angular notation.\n  - Ammo, identified as brown-colored shells, is harder to discern in this scene due to the resolution and field of view of this particular screenshot. If they are indeed present here, none are conspicuous within the immediate view. However, after this session, you may send another image centered on such an item, if available, to allow more detailed positioning information.\n\nDo keep in consideration that descriptions provided are estimates due to inherent limitations in representing the game's spaces in 3D terms from a 2D screen. Additionally, the angular positioning convention (∠θ) often depends on the point of reference and specific degrees were not given in this scenario. A complete analysis in 360 degrees would provide a much more specific location dataset. For now, any additional items out of view behind the agent or to deeper angles on the periphery are not covered in this description."
